00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello and welcome

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,500
to Multiparadigm Data Science
with the Wolfram Language,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,000
Section 3:
Get to Know Your Data.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,800
In this section,
we will look at functionality

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,300
useful for the explore stage

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,500
of the multiparadigm
project workflow.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,700
Exploratory data analysis
is really about trying to gain

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,000
an intuitive understanding
of the data.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
How are the samples
spread out in feature space?

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,800
How do the features
relate to each other?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,200
Without any analysis,
can we just look at the data

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,300
and make some sense of it?

13
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,450
We've talked about
setting up questions

14
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,450
right at the beginning

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,000
of the multiparadigm
project workflow.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,500
However, the explore stage

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,000
is where a lot
of those questions can change

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,800
and new questions emerge

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,000
as we try to figure out
what the data has to offer.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
Sometimes this stage is also used
for data QA—

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,100
checking the quality of the data

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,900
and assessing whether it is useful
and sufficient for the project.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,400
Tools used for exploratory
data analysis, or EDA,

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,000
can be categorized as graphical,
providing pictures,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,900
or non-graphical,
providing stats and numbers;

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,900
univariate, exploring one feature
or variable at a time,

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,000
or multivariate,
exploring combined behavior

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
of more than one variable—
usually two.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,300
Humans are visual beings.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,800
Instead of staring
at a column of numbers,

31
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,500
human pattern-recognition
abilities are better used in

32
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,200
visual explorations,

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,300
checking for trends,
shapes of distributions,

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,300
gaps, outliers and so on.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,000
To literally look at the data

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,400
and examine each feature
on its own

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,600
or in comparison
with other features,

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,900
we can use scatter plots,
bar charts and pie charts,

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,900
histograms, box plots,
cluster visualizations,

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,200
time series plots and so on.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's try some visual explorations
with Fisher's iris dataset.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,200
It has the length and width
of petals and sepals

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,500
of three species
of the iris flower.

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
Scatter plots are a simple
and easy way

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to look at the correlation
between two variables.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here is how the sepal lengths
of the Setosa species

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
measure against the sepal width.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,300
A scatter plot matrix shows
the pair-wise relationship

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,500
between multiple variables.

50
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
Here we see how the sepal length

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,600
corresponds to each
of the other features—

52
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,400
sepal width, petal length
and petal width.

53
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
We can repeat this
for each variable in turn,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,300
thus creating
the scatterplot matrix.

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Here is the matrix
showing the relationship

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,000
between the four variables
of all the three species of iris.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,500
Now let's look at bar charts
and pie charts,

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
two other common tools
for visual explorations.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We'll use the Old Faithful
eruptions dataset,

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,700
which provides the eruption time

61
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,000
and the waiting time
to the next eruption

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
for the Old Faithful geyser.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,300
Let's focus on the durations
of the eruptions—

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,000
elements in the first column.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We can group the samples
into four specific bins—

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
less than 2 seconds,
between 2 and 3 seconds,

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,500
3 and 4 seconds
and more than 4 seconds.

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,300
We can identify in this list

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,300
that the fourth number
is larger than the others,

70
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,600
but a bar chart or pie chart
really allows us

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,400
to compare these numbers visually
and immediately understand

72
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,300
that the eruptions
more than 4 seconds

73
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,200
are the most common ones.

74
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,700
Some other visualizations
that can be helpful

75
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,000
in exploring the data
are box whisker plots,

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
which show the max, median, min,

77
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,500
as well as first
and third quartiles.

78
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Violin plots
are similar to box plots,

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,500
but also show probability density
of the data

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,300
at different values.

81
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,500
Finally, quantile plots compare
the empirical quantiles

82
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,900
of the data values

83
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,800
against the quantiles
of a normal distribution.

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Histograms are very useful for
exploring quantitative variables.

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,000
They provide an idea
about the shape

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,300
of the underlying distribution.

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
For the duration
of the eruptions,

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,300
the histogram immediately shows
two distinct groups.

89
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,000
Paired histograms can help

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
compare the distribution of values
of both variables.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,100
For example, here are the two sets
of random numbers

92
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,700
from two normal distributions

93
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,900
with different mean
and standard deviations,

94
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,500
and here is the paired histogram
comparing them.

95
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,300
Let's compare the duration
and wait times

96
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,000
from the Old Faithful data
with a paired histogram,

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
only we have to scale
the duration values

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,300
to be in the same range
as the waiting times.

99
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,000
Overlaying plots is useful
for comparing a fit

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
with the original data,

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,900
since humans are better
at recognizing deviations

102
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,400
from straight lines.

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
Here is a comparison
of the histogram of the wait times

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,400
to an estimated distribution
for the Old Faithful data.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,900
The trusty old scatter plot
can highlight obvious correlation

106
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,500
between feature variables,

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,000
but it is also possible
to explore correlations

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
by visualizing
multivariate data in 3D

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,300
through density projections
and histograms

110
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,900
based on binning
or kernel density estimation.

111
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,000
Clustering data is often used
to separate data into groups

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,200
or to identify subgroups
within a dataset.

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
It only takes a little bit
of Wolfram Language code

114
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,500
to quickly build an interface
to interactively explore

115
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,800
different clusters in the data,

116
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,000
thereby offering the opportunity
to identify interesting outliers.

117
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,200
Let's look at some other ways

118
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,400
of quickly visualizing
clusters in the data.

119
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
ClusteringTree creates
a weighted tree

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,800
from a hierarchical clustering
of data elements,

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,300
while a Dendrogram creates a tree
where the heights of nodes

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,000
are proportional
to intercluster distances.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Before we end this segment,

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,500
let's look at
a special type of scatter plot

125
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
where one of the variables
is time.

126
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,000
So we have some unit of time
on the <i>x</i> axis,

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,500
and plot on the <i>y</i> axis
the change in values

128
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,000
of the dependent variable
with respect to time.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,300
Here is the daily mean humidity
of Champaign, Illinois,

130
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,300
in the last year, showing May
was dryer than other months.

131
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,200
Here's a similar plot
for the weekly mean temperatures

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,300
where the winter dips
and summer peaks

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,700
are easily identifiable.

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,100
These visualizations in time

135
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,000
allow us to quickly spot
any trend in the data.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,200
In summary,
we looked at various tools

137
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,000
for visually exploring our data.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,300
We looked at scatter plots,
bar charts and pie charts,

139
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,000
histograms, box plots,
violin plots,

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,400
cluster visualizations
and time series plots.

141
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,800
We hope you will be able to use
one or more

142
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,000
of these visualization tools
in the explore stage

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
of your workflow
in your next data science project.
