1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Multiparadigm Data Science
with the Wolfram Language,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Section 1: The Project Workflow.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,500
We are now ready
to work on the last stage

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,200
of our multiparadigm
project workflow.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
We have gone through
the first four stages:

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,500
setting up questions, wrangling
data, exploring and analyzing it,

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,900
and now we would like
to communicate

8
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,900
the results of our analysis.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,800
The data that we
have been working with

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
are the tweets made
by Wolfram Research.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have extracted some
useful insights from this data,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,700
and it seems like the results
would be of interest

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,500
to the social media team.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,500
Before we present our findings,

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000
it might be useful
to keep two points in mind.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,200
One: what are the needs
of the intended audience—

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
in this case,
the social media team?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,800
What are they interested in?

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,600
What will they find useful?

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,500
This will be key in communicating
the results effectively.

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,800
The word clouds we created
during the exploration

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,600
and analysis stages nicely capture
the focus of the tweets,

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
and seems like a useful result
to share with our audience.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,500
On the other hand,
the feature space plot

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,800
of the words from the tweets,

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,000
laid out in the feature space
of word vectors—

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,900
it was an interesting picture,
but not particularly informative

28
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,000
in the context
of a monthly Twitter report.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So we might not want
to include that

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,300
in the story that we want to tell
this time.

31
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Secondly, as we put together
the presentation,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,200
we would like to set up the code

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,800
so that the end data product
of the project—

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,000
whether it's an app, a microsite,

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
a report
or just a piece of visualization—

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
we would like an automated
or at least semi-automated setup

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,900
to recreate it again and again,
whether for reproducibility

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,100
or for comparative analysis.

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Let's put this together.

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,600
It's a little bit like looking at
what you have

41
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,700
in your fridge or pantry

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,600
and putting it all together with
a recipe for a delicious meal.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
What do we have so far?

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,900
To talk about the numbers, we have
a few different comparison charts

45
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,700
showing the number of tweets
by year, by month,

46
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,000
by day of week and hour of day.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We also have the total
number of tweets,

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,300
average number of tweets per day—
all useful pieces of information.

49
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,000
To talk about the content
of the tweets,

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
we have the word clouds.

51
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,600
Linking the content to numbers,
we have rankings of the hashtags

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,000
by the number of times
they were used,

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,700
or in case
of a specific hashtag,

54
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,000
which might have been the focus
of a Twitter campaign,

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
the number of times
different variants

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
of the hashtag were used.

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
While the clustering of the tweets
did not reveal

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
any of the interesting insights
we had hoped for,

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,300
we were able to use the features
of the tweets

60
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
to train a classifier

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,600
that could label a tweet
as a candidate

62
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,000
for a specific hashtag or not.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
As for the people
referred to in the tweets,

64
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,200
we were able to create a network
of Twitter handles

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,000
mentioning each other.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,400
That could help highlight
the influencers in the network.

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,200
We were also able to see
the geographical distribution

68
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
of these users around the world.

69
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
So these are all the ingredients
we have,

70
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,200
and it's up to us to whip up
an interesting recipe

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,900
to put them together
for our audience.

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,300
Also, once our preparation
is ready,

73
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,950
we have the choice to serve it up
in a few different ways—

74
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,400
basically use any of the different
tools of communication we have

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,500
to convey the results.

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Starting out with
simple visualizations—

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,900
since a picture is worth
a thousand words,

78
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,400
and audiences are often found
to favor pictures

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,300
over the written text
in presentations—

80
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,500
we could combine our pictures
together into an infographic,

81
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
the layout and annotations
customized

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,700
according to the needs
of the audience.

83
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,600
Instead of flat images,
we could make it interactive,

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,800
so someone can click through
for a dynamic comparison.

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,600
A good amount of information
can be offered

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
in a visually
concise presentation

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,200
by trying out different layouts

88
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,200
and choosing from a large variety
of visualization functions.

89
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,600
Now if we want to include
more descriptive details

90
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,000
about each piece
of visualization,

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,500
with text explanations
and also perhaps the code

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,800
so that the reader is able
to run it on their own,

93
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,900
then we could simply write
a report in a notebook—

94
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,200
making it into
a computational essay,

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
with both code and text

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,950
organized structurally
into sections

97
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,900
to walk our users step by step
through the analysis.

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,500
A high degree of customizability
in terms of style and structure

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
makes the Wolfram Notebook
the perfect tool

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,300
to create such a report.

101
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
We could directly publish it
to the cloud,

102
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,600
either making it publicly viewable
or restricting the permissions,

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
allowing only specific people
to access it.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,400
The cloud-published report
allows us the option to update it

105
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,200
as needed without having to email
multiple copies,

106
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,200
avoiding a lot of confusion
regarding the correct

107
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,400
or the latest version
of the document.

108
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Once we have the
notebook-based workflow in place,

109
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
we can of course use it
over and over again.

110
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,100
For example, we can set up
a report template like this one

111
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,800
and use it to generate a report
on the WolframResearch account

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,900
or the WolframAlpha
Twitter account—

113
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,600
it's just another
Twitter account

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,900
handled by the same
social media team.

115
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,200
We can also automate the process
of generating the report

116
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,000
by deploying a report generator
to the cloud.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,900
This code will generate a report

118
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,800
on the previous week's
Twitter activity

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,000
every Monday at 9am

120
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and email a link to the report
to the designated receivers.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We can manually trigger
the report generation

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,500
and see what it looks like,
actually.

123
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Here is the email
with the link to the report,

124
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,500
and it allows me to view it
in the browser.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,700
We can also create
a simple microsite.

126
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,900
This code creates a form that
accepts the Twitter account handle

127
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,000
that your audience
might be interested in

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,900
and provides the analysis
for the tweets from that account.

129
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,800
This makes for
the simplest of data products

130
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
resulting from
our project workflow.

131
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,000
Any one of these different ways

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,500
would help us communicate
the results of our analysis,

133
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
bringing us to the end
of our project workflow.

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,200
This notebook encapsulates
all the various stages

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
of our project workflow.

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,950
Of course,
being a notebook-based workflow

137
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,300
incorporating
the multiparadigm approach,

138
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,600
we can constantly tweak
and improve the workflow

139
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
to incorporate new data

140
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,400
or try different algorithms
or visualization techniques

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,300
to create new data products,

142
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,000
all from within the notebook.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
Notes and descriptions

144
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,700
trace the different stages
of the workflow in the notebook

145
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,300
and can be easily shared
across teams for feedback.

146
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,600
Section 1 of Multiparadigm Data
Science with the Wolfram Language

147
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,000
provided an overview
of building a project workflow.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
In the next few videos,
we will delve into more details

149
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
at each stage of the workflow

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,900
and take a closer look
at the algorithms, techniques

151
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,000
and computational tools available

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
for practicing
multiparadigm data science.
