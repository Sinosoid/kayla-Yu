00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hello and welcome
to Multiparadigm Data Science

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,400
with the Wolfram Language,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Section 2:
Getting Your Data into Shape.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In this section,
we will look at functionality

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
needed for the wrangle stage
of the workflow.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,900
Data wrangling involves
importing raw data

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,500
and converting it into
a suitable shape

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,800
for ease of use
during rest of the analysis.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
A multiparadigm workflow
has to be able to handle data

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,600
in different formats
from different sources,

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,000
reshape the data
into different structures,

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
deal with messy data,
extract useful features from it

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and, if needed,
reduce dimensionality

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,300
of high-dimensional data.

15
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,200
While dealing with all of this,
the goal is to write code

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,800
for a set of automated tools
for the data-wrangling process

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,900
so that it is much easier
to go through this stage

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,600
next time the workflow is used.

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's look at some examples

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of importing real-world data
from different sources.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
In best-case scenarios,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,200
high-quality curated data may
be available from repositories.

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
For data that has been
curated properly,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,400
there really is no need
for much wrangling—

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,000
for example,
the Wolfram Data Repository,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
which is a publicly
available resource

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
for computable datasets.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
It has curated
and structured data

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,900
available for immediate use.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,000
We can browse the site
for datasets by category

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or by type.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The data is all cleaned
and ready for computation.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,800
So if we find a dataset
that we'd like to use,

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
we can just load it
into our system

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
and start working with it.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
In addition to the
data repository,

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,600
the Wolfram Language has an
extensive built-in knowledgebase

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,900
that can be explored
for interesting data,

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,600
or it can also be leveraged

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
to augment
some existing in-house data

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
with additional information.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,700
To access this knowledgebase,

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,800
we can simply
type in words in English,

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,000
which are then interpreted
into canonical entities

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,600
representing real-world objects.

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,300
We can access the various
properties of these entities

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
and use them for computation.

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,600
There are millions of entities
across hundreds of entity types

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,500
built into the Wolfram Language.

50
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Also, there are collections
of domain-specific datasets

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,900
like geographic data,
engineering and medical data,

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,500
social, cultural
and linguistic data.

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,200
So that's curated data,

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,000
but most people want to import
their own data into the system.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,100
And we can do that
with a simple import statement

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,000
for files residing either locally
on the computer

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
or online on the web.

58
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,900
To support
a multiparadigm workflow,

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,800
the Wolfram Language can handle
a wide variety of formats.

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,000
The Import function

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,300
automatically deals
with the format of the file

62
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,900
when importing data from it.

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Sometimes it is useful to save
data and intermediate results

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
in the middle of the workflow.

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,300
Data can be saved
as Wolfram Language expressions

66
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,300
using Save or DumpSave,

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,100
and then read back in again
using Get.

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,800
Okay, now let's
move on to databases.

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
In many projects,

70
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,000
data is available
in a relational database,

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
so the multiparadigm workflow
must be able to connect

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,300
to the database
and get the data from it.

73
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,800
Here's an example of opening
a connection to a database,

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,500
looking at the tables in it
and fetching data from a table

75
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
using a Wolfram Language
function.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,300
Alternately we can use
standard SQL to fetch the data

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,300
and work with it.

78
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,000
It is also possible to represent

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,300
a relational database
symbolically

80
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,200
in the Wolfram Language

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,800
by constructing an EntityStore.

82
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,800
This allows the relational data
from the database

83
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
to be structured as entities,

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,300
very much like
the built-in entities

85
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,400
in the Wolfram Data Framework.

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,800
So now we can we can use
the same syntax to query

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,500
and use the properties of
these entities for computation.

88
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,900
Moving on to the world wide web,

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,200
which is another
major source of data,

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,500
there are multiple different ways
of getting data from the web.

91
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,400
Many online services
provide APIs,

92
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,000
which can be used to import
the data from these services.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here is an example of connecting
to the Twitter API

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,500
and downloading tweets made by
a specific Twitter handle.

95
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,800
Or we can simply search the web
for generic content

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,200
or maybe specify the type of
content we'd like to search for.

97
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
Wikipedia is another
great resource,

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
and it can be searched
not only for text,

99
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,300
but other metadata as well.

100
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,500
Finally, if we are just given
a URL,

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,600
we can simply scrape
the data off the webpage.

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Depending on the requirements
of the project,

103
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,000
we may have to scrape everything
available on the webpage

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,800
and then parse the raw data
to make sense of it,

105
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
or we can scrape specific
elements like images

106
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,300
or hyperlinks from the page.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,300
So that covers a number
of different data sources

108
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,900
that we can work with when
we are trying to wrangle data.

109
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,500
Some of us may already have
some in-house data

110
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,800
that we would like to analyze

111
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,500
as we follow the project workflow
in this course.

112
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
But for those who are looking
for interesting datasets

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
to work with, here are some
publicly available resources

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
to get started.

115
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,000
We've already looked
at the Wolfram Data Repository.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,600
The US Government's
open data website

117
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
is another great resource;

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
so is NASA's Open Data Portal,

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
UCI's Machine
Learning Repository,

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
the Kaggle contests,

121
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
the Five Thirty Eight
blog collections

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and so on.

123
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
In summary, in this segment,

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,800
we looked at importing data
from different sources—

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,600
loading it into the system
for exploration and analysis.

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,000
We looked at getting curated data
from the Wolfram Data Repository

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,600
and built-in
Wolfram Knowledgebase,

128
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,000
and we also looked
at simply importing data

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,600
from files
in a variety of formats,

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,800
residing either locally
or online on the web.

131
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,600
We looked at connecting to APIs

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,900
to download data
from online services,

133
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,200
and last but not the least,

134
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,600
we looked at scraping
data elements off webpages.

135
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
We hope you will be able to use
one or more of these options

136
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,900
in the wrangling stage
of your project.

137
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,000
In the next segment, we will
look at restructuring data

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,500
to make it ready for use
in various stages

139
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
further downstream
in the workflow.
