00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Multiparadigm Data Science
with the Wolfram Language,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Section 3:
Get to Know Your Data.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,300
We are talking
about exploratory data analysis

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,600
as a way of getting to know
your data

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,800
before really starting to use it
for modeling or machine learning.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
We've looked at some tools

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
for basic visual exploration
of the data—

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,600
a scatter plot or a simple
clustering of the samples—

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,500
things we can easily try out,

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,800
even if we have no idea how we
want to proceed with the analysis.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,000
In addition to
these traditional EDA tools,

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,600
there are many different techniques
we can borrow from various fields

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,300
to look at
our own data differently.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,500
A word cloud provides
a quick intuitive understanding

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
of the most commonly occurring
words in a piece of text,

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,900
but we can also use it
to visualize data

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,200
any time we are trying to find

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,000
the most commonly occurring
elements in a list.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For example, to find
the most popular registered

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
official language
in the countries of the UN,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
we could look at the counts

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,000
or we could look
at the word cloud,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,400
which allows us to quickly
identify the most popular ones

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,500
in comparison
to the other languages.

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,700
With two-dimensional data

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,500
like the Old Faithful
geyser eruptions

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
or the Fisher's iris samples

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,000
where we can compare
two features at a time,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
it's easy to lay out the samples
in two dimensions

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,300
and look at them.

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,000
But with more complicated data
with multiple features,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
it's hard to visualize the data
without significant preprocessing.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Wolfram Language provides
a multiparadigm tool

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,500
to easily visualize samples
in feature space

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
across different types of data.

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,000
FeatureSpacePlot,
given a list of samples,

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,300
it lays them out
in an appropriate feature space

38
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,500
for exploratory analysis.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,800
It uses sophisticated pretrained
feature extractors

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,000
for specific types of data—
like images, text or audio.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Graphs are a great tool
for information visualization.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Highlighting graph elements
helps information stand out.

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,800
By using
algorithmic graph layouts,

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,700
much of the structure in a graph,

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,500
such as connected components,
becomes self-evident.

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,000
These are the countries in Asia

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,700
and the neighbors
with whom they share a border.

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,800
Laying them out in a graph,
it becomes clear

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,700
which are the hubs sharing
borders with many neighbors,

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,600
and which seem to be

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,500
the more geographically
secluded countries.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Superimposing geographically
distributed data on maps

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,000
can provide insight
into the relationship

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,400
of the data
with the geography of the place.

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,000
These are the earthquakes
of magnitudes 7 or higher

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,400
around the world since 1980.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
Superimposing their locations
on the world map,

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,800
we see they occur
in a specific geographic region.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
A GeoHistogram highlights

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
the most seismically active parts
of this region

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,800
and reminds us
about the Ring of Fire.

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Timeline plots show
when events occur

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000
relative to each other.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Here is a TimelinePlot
of the earthquakes

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
of varying magnitudes

66
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,400
around Japan in March of 2011,

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
and we can see
this cluster of aftershocks

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,300
in the days right after

69
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,000
the Great East Japan Earthquake
and tsunami

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,100
that destroyed the Fukushima
Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.

71
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,800
In summary, we looked at
a few nontraditional tools

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,000
for visual exploration of data.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
With a multiparadigm workflow,

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,800
you can leverage functionality
from across disciplines

75
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,400
to quickly establish

76
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,500
relationships between different
types of features in the dataset

77
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,300
or to just look at your data
very differently.

78
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,000
Some of the tools we looked at
in this segment are word clouds,

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
feature space plots, graphs,
geographics and timelines.
