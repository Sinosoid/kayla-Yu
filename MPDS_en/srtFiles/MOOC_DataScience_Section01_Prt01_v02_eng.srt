00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
Hello and welcome

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,500
to Multiparadigm Data Science
with the Wolfram Language,

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,400
Section 1: The Project Workflow.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,100
Data science projects
attempt to use data

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,500
to answer certain questions

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,300
so that you can derive some
useful insights from the answers

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,100
and act on them.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,000
A flexible, modular, iterative
workflow can serve as a roadmap

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,200
in this quest to get
from data-driven questions

10
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,200
to actionable insights.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,600
Here are five stages in which
we can build up such a workflow.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
We start out with the questions,

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,800
then move on
to the data-wrangling stage

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,100
where we import the data
and shape it.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,400
Then we do some
exploratory analysis

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,100
to get an intuitive understanding
of the data

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,700
before launching
into the analysis stage

18
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
to try different
models, algorithms

19
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,900
and techniques
to dissect the data.

20
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,100
Finally, we try to communicate
the results

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,000
in a clear and comprehensive way
to our audience.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What the multiparadigm
approach adds

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,300
to this otherwise
straightforward path

24
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,200
is the option to work
with different types of data:

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,000
flat files or databases,
audio or images, sensor readings,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
data scraped off the web.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
And at the same time,

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,700
it provides the scope
to branch out

29
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,800
at every stage of the workflow,

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,700
experimenting with and assembling

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,000
a broad, flexible,
computational toolkit

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,500
to incorporate
data processing, analysis

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,800
and visualization capabilities

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,300
into one
start-to-finish workflow.

35
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,200
And you build
this workflow iteratively,

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,500
in the spirit
of agile development.

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,400
You keep tweaking
and modifying different stages—

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,900
all the while keeping
the original question in mind.

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,900
Your workflow is driven
by the questions,

40
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,900
and it is not restricted
to traditional techniques

41
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,000
associated with a specific kind
of data or field of study.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Let's try to use
this workflow template

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,400
to execute a simple
data science project.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,900
Let's do some
social media analysis.

45
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,000
We'll look at
the Wolfram Research Twitter feed

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,500
and see if we can get some
data-driven insights out of it.

47
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,900
So here are the tweets,
containing text, URLs, hashtags,

48
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,500
mentions of other users,
et cetera.

49
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,400
From this data, we want to create
a report on the Twitter activity—

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,300
something like this,
which would perhaps help

51
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,400
the social media team

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,200
to strategize
for a Twitter campaign.

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,700
The first stage of the workflow
is where we frame the questions.

54
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,000
To get some useful conclusions
from the data,

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
we need to start out
with the right questions.

56
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
We have a list of tweets
made by Wolfram Research.

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,300
What can we learn from them?

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
Now that is
a pretty broad question.

59
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,000
It makes sense to break it down
into few specific questions

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,500
that can guide our analysis—
questions like:

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
How many tweets are sent?

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,200
How many of these
are being liked or retweeted?

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Which hashtags
are used most often,

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,500
which should indicate
what topics are being discussed?

65
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Also, who were mentioned
in these tweets,

66
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,200
to highlight the people involved
in these conversations?

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,600
In addition
to the topic-specific questions,

68
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,500
it's helpful to keep in mind
the audience of the analysis

69
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,000
right from the start.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,700
For this example project,
the end audience could be

71
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,000
hypothetically
Wolfram's social media team.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Perhaps they would like to see
a monthly report

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
on the account's Twitter activity—
a snapshot that presents answers

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,900
to questions like how many, what,
who, with regard to the tweets.

75
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,100
Now the questions can be fuzzy
as we start out,

76
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,200
and they can change later.

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,700
In fact, more interesting
questions may surface

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,400
as we sift through the data.

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,500
However, it is important
to set up these questions

80
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
at the beginning
with the audience in mind.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,900
Otherwise, with the sheer
variety of things

82
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,200
that we can try with the data,
we might end up wasting time

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,800
on unnecessary analysis.

84
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Now that we have some questions,

85
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
let's get our hands on the data
and see what we can find out.
