00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Multiparadigm Data Science
with the Wolfram Language,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Section 3:
Get to Know Your Data.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,600
In this last segment
on exploratory data analysis,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,300
we'll look at some
of the statistical tools

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,200
that can be helpful in developing

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,200
a preliminary understanding
of the data.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,800
While visualizations
are cool to look at,

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,100
numbers play an important part

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,800
in our understanding
of the world around us.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,500
Tukey's five-number summary—

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,400
minimum, maximum, median
and the first and third quartiles—

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
provides a concise summary

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of the distribution
of observations.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,900
Since these are order statistics
rather than, say, the mean,

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,200
the five-number summary
can be used for ordinal features

16
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,000
as well as features representing
interval and ratio measurements.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,600
Let's revisit
the Fisher iris dataset

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,400
that we explored visually in
the first segment of the section

19
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,800
Get to Know Your Data,

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800
but this time,
let's look at some

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,500
of the descriptive statistics
for the features.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,700
Here are the mean
and standard deviation

23
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,800
for a single variable, that is,
sepal length for the setosa class.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,500
This table visualizes the
information for all three classes

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
for different types
of descriptive statistics

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,800
like mean, variance,
median, et cetera.

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,900
These can also be computed
for more than one variable—

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,700
in this case, sepal length,

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,800
sepal width, petal length
and petal width.

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,300
Here are the descriptive
statistics at a glance

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,400
for all four variables
across the three classes.

32
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,800
Among other numbers that can be
useful in understanding the data,

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,300
we have frequency counts
that can tell us

34
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,000
about the number of samples
of a particular type,

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and we also have
Pearson's correlation coefficient,

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,500
which measures the strength
of the linear relationship

37
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,200
between two variables.

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
While scatter plots can show
correlation visually

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,300
in two dimensions,

40
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,000
calculating the linear correlation
for multivariate samples

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
can be helpful,

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,500
especially when we'd like
to use these numbers

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,200
for further analysis.

44
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,700
For the Fisher iris dataset,
it seems that features 3 and 4

45
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,500
show strong linear correlation
while features 1 and 2 do not.

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,200
As Hans Rosling said,

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,600
it's true that, "the world cannot
be understood with numbers alone,"

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,000
but he did preface his quote,
saying,

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
"the world cannot be understood
without numbers."

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,300
Hopefully the statistical tools
we looked at in this segment

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,800
will allow you to gain a better
understanding of your data,

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
along with
the visual explorations,

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,500
in the setting of a
multiparadigm project workflow.

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Ideally as we wind up EDA,

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,300
we should be able to answer
the following questions

56
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,700
satisfactorily about our project:

57
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,000
Do we have the data as needed
for the planned analysis?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
Is there enough of it?

59
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Does the data seem to be accurate?

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Are there obvious errors?

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,400
Is the data missing something?

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,500
Is the data relevant?

63
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,400
Are there outliers?

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,500
Are there some characteristics
of the features

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,700
that attract attention right away?

66
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,600
Here is a checklist
that can be helpful

67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,800
whenever we have a new dataset
and are trying to navigate

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,500
the explore stage of the
multiparadigm project workflow.

69
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
If you have some data, try to:

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Visualize it in feature space
in 2 or 3 dimensions.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Either use pairs of raw features,

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
or project all features
to lower dimensions.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,000
Create scatterplot matrices

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,600
to look at pairwise relationships
between the variables.

75
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
Plot distributions of all variables.

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,500
Start with a single distribution
for a single variable,

77
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,400
and go on to joint distributions
of pairs of variables.

78
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,500
Overlay plots and graphs

79
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
to compare distribution shapes
to histograms.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Look for deviations.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Visualize clusters
to identify outliers,

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,100
and also to look
for obvious errors

83
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,700
or gaps in the data plots.

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,500
Plot time series data
and identify trends.

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,800
Reach out across disciplines
for visualization tools

86
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
that may lend a different
perspective on the data.

87
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Last but not the least,
generate summary statistics

88
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,000
for each independent variable
or feature,

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,300
and also look
at pairwise relationships

90
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,800
or correlation
between the variables.

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
Successful EDA
while exploring the data collected

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,900
can help identify user stories

93
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,000
to make sure
the downstream analysis

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
has a real purpose.

95
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,400
It can help formulate
the right questions,

96
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,300
provide clues about what algorithm
to use down the line

97
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,000
and allow tweaking of
the multiparadigm project workflow

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,300
to include the right set of tools

99
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,000
useful for answering
those questions.
