64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
这意味着分离出图像的不同部分。
which means separating out different parts of the image.

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,100
有分割的方法很多。
There are many methods of segmentation.

66

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,500
基于亮度。
based on brightness.

69
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
从分割结果在这里代表
The result from segmentation is represented here

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,500
by a black-and-white image,

71
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,000
与由该搜索结果的白色部分中确定的明亮的段

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,700
和较暗的段确定了黑色部分。
and the darker segment identified by the black parts.

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
一旦图像被分割，
Once the image has been segmented,

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,300
有可以用它做很多事情。
there are many things that can be done with it.

75
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,900
例如，该挑选出的最大的连接分量

76
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,000
在分割，
in that segmentation,

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,500
在该示例中是比萨饼的切片。

所谓的图像分析，
called image analysis,

87
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
其目的是从图像获取信息
where the goal is to get information from the image

88
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
而不是仅仅修改图像来获得另一幅图像。
instead of just modifying the image to get another image.

89
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,400
有分割的许多其他方法。
There are many other methods of segmentation.

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,900
一种方法是聚类，这可以，例如，
One method is clustering, which can, for example,

91
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,600
段由图像中的编组相似的颜色的图像。
segment an image by grouping similar colors in an image.

92
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
这说明细分的集群
This shows segmentation by clustering

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,900
用于将样本图像分离成五个段。

94
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,800
彩色化功能在这里使用
The Colorize function is used here

95
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
显示以对比色每个段。
to display each segment in a contrasting color.

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,900
分割的另一种方法是分水岭分割。

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,200
分割通过聚类在第7节中描述了
Segmentation by clustering is described in Section 7,

101
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,500
和分割的其它方法在第11部分中描述。
and other methods of segmentation are described in Section 11.

102
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,000
之一中使用的图像段的是作为掩模
One use of an image segment is as a mask

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,300
提供一种方式做事对图像的选定部分。

104
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,500
例如，这示出了分割
For example, this shows a segmentation

105
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,000
从一切比萨分离图像中，
that separates the pizza from everything else in the image,

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,400
这使用了链段作为掩模
and this uses that segment as a mask

107
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,950
从一切去除颜色
to remove color from everything

108
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,400
除图像的掩盖部以外。
other than the masked part of the image.

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
所以背景变成了黑色和白色
So the background becomes black and white

110
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
和比萨饼是彩色。
and the pizza remains in color.

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
有迹象表明，可以用颜色做很多其他的事情。
There are many other things that can be done with color.

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,900
下面是使用ColorDistance功能的输入

126
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,000
这确实去除噪声的稍微好一点的工作
that does a slightly better job of removing the noise

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
同时保留在图像中尖锐的边缘。

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,600
图像缺陷常常可以校正
Image defects can often be corrected

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
使用称为修补方法，

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,800
其使用颜色和纹理通过填充工作在缺陷
which works by filling in defects using colors and textures

131
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,400
从图像的周边部分。

132
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
对于补绘，图像的一部分
For inpainting, the part of the image

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,700
即在通过掩模鉴定填补。
that is to be filled in is identified by a mask.

134
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,000
由此可见修补用掩模使用
This shows inpainting used with a mask

135
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,900
该标识的一切比其他披萨
that identifies everything other than the pizza

136
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,400
作为图像的部分将被填充，
as the part of the image that is to be filled in,

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
这基本上消除了背景。
which basically removes the background.

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,300
有了一些调整，
With a few adjustments,

139
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,100
背景也可以用更多的比萨饼填充。
the background can also be filled in with more pizza.

basic features of an image like lines and edges.

145
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,600
例如，这显示了ImageLines起作用
For example, this shows the ImageLines function

146
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,400
用于检测图像中的行。
used to detect lines in an image.

147
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
在这个例子中，这些线路可以是有用
In this example, those lines could be useful

148

151
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,700
几乎在图像上任何事情都可能是一个特征。
almost anything on an image could be a feature.

152
